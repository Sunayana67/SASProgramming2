LESSON 2, PRACTICE 5 
1) Create a new program.
   a. Create a sorted copy of sashelp.shoes that is ordered by Region and Product.
   b. Use the DATA step to read the sorted table and create a new table named profitummary.
   c. Create a column named Profit that is the difference between Sales and Returns.
   d. Create an accumulating column named TotalProfit that is a running total of Profit within each value of Region and Product.
   e. Reset TotalProfit for each new combination of Region and Product.
   f. Submit the program and verify that TotalProfit is accurate.
2) Modify the DATA step.
   a. Include only the last row for each Region and Product combination.
   b. Keep Region, Product, and TotalProfit.
   c. Format TotalProfit as a currency value.
   d. Submit the program and examine the output data.
