LESSON 2, PRACTICE 2
1) Create a table, parkTypeTraffic, from the pg2.np_yearlytraffic table. Use the following specifications:

   b. Create two new columns named MonumentTraffic and ParkTraffic. The value of each column should be increased by the value of Count for that park type.
   c. Format the new columns so that values are displayed with commas.
2) Create a listing report of parkTypeTraffic.
   a. Use Accumulating Traffic Totals for Park Types as the report title.
   b. Display the columns in this order: ParkType, ParkName, Location, Count, MonumentTraffic, and ParkTraffic.
   c. Submit the program and view the results.
