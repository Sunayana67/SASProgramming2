LESSON 2, PRACTICE 6 
Create a new program.
1) Write a DATA step that creates two tables, singlestate and multistate, from the pg2.np_acres table.
2) The singlestate table includes the rows with unique park names.
3) The multistate table includes the rows with park names that appear in multiple states.
4) The parks should be grouped within their associated regions.
5) When sorting the data, keep only the Region, ParkName, State, and GrossAcres columns.
6) Submit the program and examine the output data.
